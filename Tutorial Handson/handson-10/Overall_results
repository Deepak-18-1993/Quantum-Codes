Exercise 1:As mentioned above, change the force convergence criterion and observe how many iterations are taken for
relaxation to complete

Result:
Instead of 16 iterations the new calculation gives the following output:

 bfgs converged in  23 scf cycles and  21 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-04, force <  1.0E-06)

Exercise 2:Try the lattice optimization and the convergence tests for this surface. You will have to replace the calculations
field in &SYSTEM card from "relax" to "scf" and then run the tests.

Result: In folder Exercise2

Exercise 3: Subsequent to this, rerun the relaxation calculation and report the final energy, with the converged set of pa-
rameters

Result:
 Witout converged parameters  Final energy   =     -28.9485277447 Ry
 With Converged parameters    Final energy   =     -29.0005146113 Ry
